This repository is a collection of all my work that I felt showed my accomplishments throughout my journey as a computer science major.
In this you'll see projects that I've made to understand the world of data structures and algorithms while also being a source that I can use for future projects to help improve the efficiency of my work.
You'll also see projects that I've made in order to practice my understand of the many levels of coding, especially learning new tools and frameworks.
Other projects would be for fun like making something random or a game just to practice my skills at developing software for myself.
